    <h4 style="margin-top: 16px;">BGI-CGL Respects Your Privacy</h4>
    <p>The BGI Cognitive Genomics Lab (BGI-CGL) recognizes the importance of
privacy and respects your desire for your data to be stored and accessed in a
secure manner.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Statement is intended to make you aware of how we handle
your Personal Information.  We are committed to providing you a secure,
user-controlled environment for data provision and the use of our Services.  At
the same time, you share responsibility for maintaining privacy and
security--for example, by keeping your login information secure.</p>
    <p>We encourage you to familiarize yourself with our Privacy Statement.
Our Consent Form explains that, by using our website and volunteering to
participate in our research, you are allowing us to process your Personal
Information according to the provisions set forth in the Consent Form and this
Privacy Statement.</p>
    <h4>Your Personal Information</h4>
    <p>In the course of your participation in BGI-CGL's research, we collect
several types of Personal Information.  Personal Information is information
that could be used to identify you, either alone or in combination with other
information.  We collect such information from you when you create a personal
account and complete surveys and forms.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Registration Information" is the information we collect from you
when you create an account.  Examples of such information include your name,
mailing address, email address, and birthdate.</li>
      <li>"Genetic Information" consists of your genotype, e.g. the As, Ts, Cs,
and Gs at particular locations in your genome.  Genetic Information is
generated when you volunteer to receive BGI-CGL's Service and your saliva
sample (or other tissue sample) is analyzed and processed or you otherwise
contribute or access your Genetic Information through our Services.  Our
instructions for sample collection and shipment clearly require you to send
only your saliva sample to our designated processing center labeled with the
unique barcode and no other identifier.  The unique barcode identifies you to
us but not to the laboratory.  No other Personal Information is required for
the analysis.  To protect your privacy, receiving personnel at the laboratory
will remove and discard any identifying information (e.g. name, address)
included with saliva samples before testing personnel receive the samples for
genotyping.  Receiving personnel do not perform testing, and testing personnel
only handle samples labeled with the unique barcode.  DNA and saliva samples
are destroyed after the laboratory completes its work, provided that laboratory
legal and regulatory requirements no longer require the actual samples to be
maintained.  The laboratory securely sends the resulting Genetic Information to
us along with your unique barcode.  Genetic Information is stored securely on
our servers; the laboratory also stores your Genetic Information, but labeled
only with a sample barcode.  The laboratory conducting DNA extraction and
analysis does not have access to your name, other Registration Information, or
any other Personal Information.</li>
      <li>"Self-Reported Information" includes information you provide to us,
including but not limited to information about your test scores, educational
credentials, personal traits (e.g. height, weight), ethnicity, and/or family
history (e.g. similar information about family members).  We collect this
information from you if and when you enter the information into surveys, forms,
or features while signed in to your account.  Self-Reported Information is
included in BGI-CGL Research only if it has been indicated for BGI-CGL Research
use on the website and if you have given consent as described in the applicable
Consent Document.</li>
      <li>"Web Behavior Information" is information on how you use the BGI-CGL
website (e.g. browser type, domains, page views) collected through log files,
cookies, and web beacon technology.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How We Use Registration Information</h4>
    <p>We use your Registration Information to authenticate your website visits
and usage; to validate certain Self-Reported Information; to send you the
sample collection kit; to enable your use of our Services; to communicate with
you about information, services, and products that you have requested; and to
manage and improve our website, software, and Services.  We give you the
opportunity to opt out of optional communications, either through our Service
or by contacting our Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacy@cog-genomics.org">privacy@cog-genomics.org</a>.</p>
    <h4>How We Use Genetic and Self-Reported Information</h4>
    <p>We use your Genetic and Self-Reported Information to test our research
hypotheses and provide you with BGI-CGL Services.</p>
    <p>If, and only if, you have given consent to participate in BGI-CGL
Research as described in the applicable Consent Document, we may include your
Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information indicated for BGI-CGL
Research use in Aggregated Genetic and Self-Reported Information disclosed to
third parties for the purpose of publication in a peer-reviewed scientific
journal.  BGI-CGL Research is intended to advance genetic knowledge.</p>
    <h4>How We Use Web Behavior Information</h4>
    <p>Web Behavior Information is collected through log files, cookies, and
web beacon technology during a visit to the BGI-CGL website.  Web Behavior
Information is used to improve our Services and the overall user
experience.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Log Files</b>.  When users visit our website, BGI-CGL gathers
certain information automatically and stores it in log files.  This information
may include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service
Provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and
clickstream data (i.e. a list of pages or URLs visited).  We use this
information, which is not designed to identify individual users, to analyze
trends, administer the site, track users' movements around the site, and gather
demographic information about our user base as a whole.  We may, in some
circumstances, need to review this automatically collected data in combination
with specific Registration Information to identify and resolve issues for
individual users.</li>
      <li><b>Cookies</b>.  The BGI-CGL website also uses cookies.  A cookie is
a small text file that is stored on a user's computer when you visit our
website or any other website through your computer.  We use both session
cookies and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site,
improve the security of your Personal Information, enhance the functionality of
certain features, and improve performance.  The cookies we employ are used to
enable secure access to your account when you are signed in to your account and
are only applicable within the confines of our website.<br>
A session cookie expires when you close your browser.  A persistent cookie
remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  You can remove
persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's
"help" file.  However, if you set your browser to reject cookies, your ability
to use our site will be significantly impaired.  In particular, you will not be
able to access any part of our site that requires a sign-in, such as your
account.</li>
      <li><b>Web Beacons</b>.  A web beacon is a clear graphic image that is
loaded by your web browser when it accesses a website and that records a user's
visit to a particular web page.  We, or third parties that work for us, may
place cookies and web beacons on our website, in our emails, and in our
advertisements that appear on other websites or in emails sent by others.  We
may use beacons to determine when someone views a web page, count how many
individuals visit our website after clicking advertisements placed on other
websites, or count how many people have volunteered after viewing an
advertisement we placed.  Web beacons may also help us determine the
effectiveness of an email campaign because the beacons can count the number of
individuals who open an email or forward it to others.  We use this Web
Behavior information to better tailor our participant outreach.<br>
If you wish to disable web beacons, it is possible to prevent your browser from
loading them, although there is not currently a standard method for doing
so.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Information Sharing</h4>
    <p>You may choose to disclose, through other means not associated with
BGI-CGL, any part of your Personal Information to friends and/or family
members, groups of individuals, third-party service providers, doctors or other
health care professionals, and/or other individuals.  We recommend that you
make such choices carefully.</p>
    <p>Personal Information, once released or shared, can be difficult to
contain.  BGI-CGL will have no responsibility or liability for any consequences
that may result because you have released or shared Personal Information with a
third party.</p>
    <h4>Information Disclosure</h4>
    <p>As a general rule, BGI-CGL will not disclose your individual-level
Personal Information to any third party, except under the following
circumstances: (1) we are required to do so by law (see the section below
entitled "Information Disclosure Required by Law"); or (2) you have provided
explicit consent for us to do so.  However, BGI-CGL may disclose Aggregated
Genetic and Self-Reported Information intended to be published in a
peer-reviewed scientific journal to research collaborators or as a result of
publication.  We emphasize that Aggregated Genetic and Self-Reported
Information will be stripped of names, physical addresses, email addresses, and
any other Personal Information that may be used to identify you as a unique
individual.</p>
    <h4>Information Disclosure Required By Law</h4>
    <p>Under certain circumstances Personal Information may be subject to
disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or
orders.  You acknowledge and agree that BGI-CGL is free to preserve and
disclose any and all Personal Information to law enforcement agencies or others
if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation
or disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a
judicial proceeding, court order, or government inquiry) or obligations that
BGI-CGL may owe pursuant to ethical and other professional rules, laws, and
regulations.</p>
    <h4>Children's Privacy</h4>
    <p>BGI-CGL is committed to protecting the privacy of children as well as
adults. A parent or guardian may
collect a saliva sample from, create an account for, and provide Self-Reported
Information on behalf of his or her child.  The parent or guardian assumes full
responsibility for ensuring that the information that he/she provides to
BGI-CGL about his or her child is kept secure and that the information
submitted is accurate.</p>
    <h4>Security</h4>
    <p>BGI-CGL takes seriously the trust you place in us. Hackers are a risk which you must be aware of before your participation, but we have taken high-level measures to countermand any unauthorized access to BGI-CGL data. These include:
  </p><ul>
	<li>BGI-CGL uses a range of reasonable physical,
technical, and administrative measures to safeguard your Personal Information,
in accordance with current technological and industry standards.  In
particular, all connections to and from our website are encrypted using Secure
Socket Layer (SSL) technology. 	</li>
	<li>All genomic data (gata) is stored separate from any Personal Information, identified only by a masked ID.</li>
	<li>Each of these databases is encrypted discretely, and stored discretely.</li>
	<li>The key linking these databases is masked. Hence, even a hacker gaining access to respectively encrypted databases from two distinct locations would not be able to link any gata with any personal ID, without also gaining access to a third ID demasking key.</li>
  </ul>
     <p>Please recognize that protecting your Personal Information is also your
responsibility.  We ask you to be responsible for safeguarding your password,
secret questions and answers, and other authentication information you use to
access our Services.  You should not disclose your authentication information
to any third party and should immediately notify BGI-CGL of any unauthorized
use of your password.  BGI-CGL cannot secure Personal Information that you
release on your own or that you request us to release.</p>
